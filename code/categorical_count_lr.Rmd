## LR under the proposed model

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Recall that the formula for the likelihood ratio under the proposed model is

## Functions for computing the LR

* `calc_lnlr` calculates the natural log transformed likelihood ratio for a given set of prior parameters and pair of counts. This just implements the formula above (on the natural log scale for stability).
* `get_lnlr_from_seq` calculates natural log transformed likelihood ratios for a given set of prior parameters and sequence of events. This could be provided via two sequences to compare or a single sequence with a dividing event index. Can also be provided with a window of event indices around which to do the calculations, instead of for a fixed dividing time.

```{r calc-lnlr}

# Calculate the ln(LR) for a given pair of counts and prior
#
# alpha: vector of length K containing the Dirichlet prior parameters
# r1: vector of length K containing the event counts for the known source
# r2: vector of length K containing the event counts for the unknown source
#
calc_lnlr <- function(r1, r2, alpha = NA) {
  
  if(length(r1) != length(r2)) {
    stop("Different K's implied by r1 and r2.")
  }
  
  if (sum(is.na(alpha)) == 0) {
    alpha <- rep(1, length(r1))
  } else {
    if (length(alpha) != length(r1)) {
      stop("Different K's implied by alpha and r1.")
    }
  }
  
  sum(lgamma(alpha + r1 + r2)) - lgamma(sum(alpha + r1 + r2)) - 
    sum(lgamma(alpha + r1)) + lgamma(sum(alpha + r1)) - 
    sum(lgamma(alpha + r2)) + lgamma(sum(alpha + r2)) + 
    sum(lgamma(alpha)) - lgamma(sum(alpha))
}

```

```{r get-lr-from-seq}

# Calculate the ln(LR) for a given sequence of events
#
# event_seq: vector containing a sequence of events
#   - if event_seq2 is also specified, then event_seq consists of only the known
#     source events (N_1 events) and then event_seq2 will have the unknown 
#     source events (N_2 events)
#   - if event_seq2 is not also specified, then this event sequence has all N
#     events and will be split up into N_1 + N_2 events
# event_seq2: optional vector containing the unknown source events
#   - will be used to compare against event_seq
# event_ind: either a single integer or a vector of integers specifying the  
#             event indices (i.e., N_1's) at which to calculate the LR
#   - if not specified with a single sequence, defaults to floor of N / 2
#   - if not specified with two sequences, defaults to just comparing the two
#     sequences
#   - if specified as a single integer, function will return a single LR value
#   - if specified as a vector, function will return a vector of LR values
# categories: vector of length K specifying the LR categories
#   - if not specified, defaults to the event types in event_seq
#   - note that if specified, events in event_seq not in these categories will 
#     be ignored
# alpha: vector of length K containing the Dirichlet prior parameters
#   - if not specified, defaults to uniform Dirichlet

## Toy examples

```{r}
set.seed(NULL)
set.seed(1234)
```

Let's consider three event types of interest, "A", "B", and "C".

```{r}
toy_categories <- c("A", "B", "C")
```

Suppose we have identical event counts, $r_1 = r_2 = (2, 1, 0)$.
We can use the `calc_lnlr` function in order to calculate the likelihood ratio using these counts directly.

```{r}
exp(calc_lnlr(
  alpha = c(1, 1, 1),
  r1 = c(2, 1, 0), 
  r2 = c(2, 1, 0))
)
```

We could also represent these counts as two sequences and then calculate the likelihood ratio.

```{r}
exp(get_lnlr_from_seq(
  event_seq = c("A", "A", "B"),
  event_seq2 = c("A", "A", "B"),
  categories = toy_categories)
)
```

Or alternatively as a single sequence with a specified dividing index.

```{r}
exp(get_lnlr_from_seq(
  event_seq = rep(c("A", "A", "B"), 2),
  categories = toy_categories,
  event_ind = 3)
)
```

We could also evaluate the likelihood ratio throughout a window of events in the sequence, instead of only at a fixed event index.
The function below calculates the likelihood ratio three times on the sequence: "A", "A", "B", "A", "A", "B".

* A, A VS. B, A, A, B
* A, A, B VS. A, A, B
* A, A, B, A, VS. A, B

```{r}
exp(get_lnlr_from_seq(
  event_seq = rep(c("A", "A", "B"), 2),
  categories = toy_categories,
  event_ind = c(2, 3, 4))
)
```

We can also do this for a longer sequence and then plot the resulting likelihood ratios across the event indices.
We construct a sequence of 1000 events; the first 500 will be mostly "A" events and then there's a change and the second 500 events will be mostly "C" events.
Ideally, the likelihood ratio demonstrates that there is a change around the 500th event.

```{r lr_plot}
long_seq <- c(
  toy_categories[sample(seq(3), size = 500, prob = c(0.9, 0.05, 0.05), replace = TRUE)],
  toy_categories[sample(seq(3), size = 500, prob = c(0.05, 0.05, 0.9), replace = TRUE)]
)

lnlr <- get_lnlr_from_seq(
  event_seq = long_seq,
  categories = toy_categories,
  event_ind = seq(1, 999)
)

plot(seq(1, 999), lnlr, type = "l", lwd = 2, xlab = "Event index", ylab = "ln(LR)")
abline(v = 500, lwd = 2, col = "red")
```
